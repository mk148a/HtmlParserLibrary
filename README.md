# HtmlParserLibrary

HtmlParserLibrary is a .NET library designed for efficiently converting HTML content to JSON and vice versa. This library provides robust error handling and preprocessing mechanisms to handle common HTML parsing issues, such as self-closing tags, invalid XML characters, and malformed HTML. It is built for high performance and is well-suited for large-scale data processing.

## Features

- **HTML to JSON Conversion**: Convert HTML structures into a well-formed JSON format. Handles complex nested elements, attributes, and text content.
- **JSON to HTML Conversion**: Rebuild HTML from JSON structures, preserving the original document's structure, elements, and attributes.
- **Error Handling**: Catches and processes XML parsing errors, allowing continued processing even with malformed or incomplete HTML.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes mechanisms to preprocess HTML content to make it XML-compliant, addressing issues like self-closing tags and ampersand handling.
- **Large-Scale Processing**: Capable of processing large JSON datasets efficiently, with mechanisms to chunk and handle extensive data.

## Installation

You can install the HtmlParserLibrary via NuGet (coming soon) or clone the repository and build it manually.

```bash
dotnet add package HtmlParserLibrary
```

## Usage

### Converting HTML to JSON

```csharp
using HtmlParserLibrary;

string htmlContent = "<html><head><title>Example</title></head><body><p>Hello, world!</p></body></html>";
HtmlParser parser = new HtmlParser();
string jsonOutput = parser.ConvertHtmlToJson(htmlContent);

Console.WriteLine(jsonOutput);
```

### Converting JSON to HTML

```csharp
using HtmlParserLibrary;

string jsonContent = "Your JSON content here...";
HtmlParser parser = new HtmlParser();
string htmlOutput = parser.ConvertJsonToHtml(jsonContent);

Console.WriteLine(htmlOutput);
```

### Processing JSON Data

```csharp
using HtmlParserLibrary;

string jsonContent = "Your JSON content here...";
HtmlParser parser = new HtmlParser();
List<string> processedList = parser.ProcessJsonData(jsonContent);

foreach (var chunk in processedList)
{
    Console.WriteLine(chunk);
}
```

## Error Handling

The library is designed to handle XML parsing errors gracefully. If an error occurs during the conversion process, the library will return the raw HTML content as part of the JSON output, allowing you to inspect and handle the issue manually.
